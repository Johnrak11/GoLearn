**My advice for a 3-month deadline:**
If you know JavaScript, go with **Node.js + Prisma**. If you know PHP, go with **Laravel**. Both work perfectly with Docker and MariaDB.

### 2. Database Analysis (Schema Design)

Based on the modules in your image, here is a recommended database structure for **MariaDB**.

#### A. Users & Authentication

* **`users`**
* `id` (PK, UUID or Auto-increment)
* `email` (Unique)
* `password_hash`
* `full_name`
* `role` (ENUM: 'student', 'instructor', 'admin')
* `avatar_url`
* `created_at`



#### B. Course Management

* **`courses`**
* `id` (PK)
* `instructor_id` (FK -> users.id)
* `title`
* `description`
* `thumbnail_url`
* `price` (Decimal)
* `is_published` (Boolean)
* `created_at`


* **`modules`** (Courses are broken down into modules/chapters)
* `id` (PK)
* `course_id` (FK -> courses.id)
* `title`
* `order_index` (To sort modules 1, 2, 3...)


* **`lessons`** (The actual content inside modules)
* `id` (PK)
* `module_id` (FK -> modules.id)
* `title`
* `type` (ENUM: 'video', 'text', 'quiz')
* `video_url` (For the Video Player Integration)
* `duration_seconds`
* `order_index`



#### C. Enrollment & Progress

* **`enrollments`** (Links Students to Courses)
* `id` (PK)
* `user_id` (FK)
* `course_id` (FK)
* `payment_status` (ENUM: 'paid', 'pending', 'free')
* `transaction_id` (From Payment Gateway)
* `enrolled_at`


* **`lesson_progress`** (Progress Tracker)
* `id` (PK)
* `enrollment_id` (FK)
* `lesson_id` (FK)
* `is_completed` (Boolean)
* `last_watched_position` (Integer, seconds - to resume video)



#### D. Quiz System

* **`quizzes`**
* `id` (PK)
* `lesson_id` (FK - if the quiz is part of a lesson)
* `title`
* `passing_score`


* **`questions`**
* `id` (PK)
* `quiz_id` (FK)
* `question_text`
* `type` (ENUM: 'multiple_choice', 'true_false')


* **`options`**
* `id` (PK)
* `question_id` (FK)
* `option_text`
* `is_correct` (Boolean)


* **`quiz_attempts`**
* `id` (PK)
* `user_id` (FK)
* `quiz_id` (FK)
* `score`
* `passed` (Boolean)
* `attempted_at`



#### E. Forum & Logs

* **`forum_posts`**
* `id` (PK)
* `course_id` (FK)
* `user_id` (FK)
* `parent_id` (FK, Nullable - for replies)
* `content`
* `created_at`


* **`activity_logs`**
* `id` (PK)
* `user_id` (FK)
* `action` (String e.g., "enrolled_course", "finished_quiz")
* `metadata` (JSON - optional details)
* `created_at`

### 3. API Scope & Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

Since you need to document the API, you should define your "Resources" clearly. Here is the checklist of endpoints you need to build:

| Resource | Key Endpoints (Methods) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Auth** | `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/register` | Returns JWT Token. |
| **Profile** | `GET /profile`, `PUT /profile` | Get or update current user info. |
| **Courses** | `GET /courses`, `GET /courses/{id}` | List courses (with search/filter) and course details. |
| **Content** | `GET /courses/{id}/curriculum` | Returns the tree of Modules -> Lessons -> Videos. |
| **Enroll** | `POST /enrollments` | Purchase/Enroll in a course. |
| **Progress** | `POST /progress/update` | Mark lesson as complete or update video timestamp. |
| **Quiz** | `GET /quizzes/{id}`, `POST /quizzes/{id}/submit` | Fetch questions, Submit answers & get score. |
| **Forum** | `GET /courses/{id}/forum`, `POST /forum` | Read and write comments. |

**Tip:** Use **Swagger UI**. It automatically creates a website where your Mobile App teammates can see the URL, parameters, and test the API without asking you questions every 5 minutes.

### 4. Hosting & Server Setup (Docker + SSL)

You have a domain, a server with Docker, and MariaDB. Here is the architecture you should set up:

**The Architecture:**

1. **Docker Container 1: MariaDB** (Database - you already have this).
2. **Docker Container 2: Backend API** (Your Node.js or Laravel app).
3. **Docker Container 3: Nginx (Reverse Proxy)**.




Based on your project description and the modules provided in the image, here is a detailed **Scope and Feature Analysis**. This will serve as your roadmap for the next 3 months.

Since you are a team of three, I have categorized the scope into **Core (Must-Have)** and **Secondary (Should-Have)** to help you manage the deadline.

---

## 1. Functional Scope Analysis

### A. User Management & Access Control

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** This is the "brain" of your app.
* **Students:** Can browse, enroll, watch videos, take quizzes, and track their own progress.
* **Instructors:** Can create courses, upload video content, and manage quiz questions.


* **Auth System:** Secure Sign-up, Login (using JWT for mobile), and Profile Management (uploading avatars, changing passwords).

### B. Course & Content Delivery

* **Hierarchical Content:** You must support a structure of `Course -> Module -> Lesson`.
* **Video Streaming:** Integration of a video player. For the backend, this means storing metadata (URLs) for videos hosted on a storage service (like AWS S3 or even YouTube/Vimeo embeds).
* **Search & Discovery:** A search engine to find courses by title, category, or instructor name.

### C. Engagement & Evaluation

* **Dynamic Quiz System:** The ability to serve multiple-choice questions and calculate scores immediately upon submission.
* **Progress Tracker:** A logic-heavy feature where the backend marks a lesson as "Complete" only after the video is finished or the quiz is passed.
* **Interactive Forum:** A nested commenting system (Threaded Q&A) for each course so students can help each other.

### D. Operational Features

* **Payment Gateway:** Integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or a local gateway) to unlock courses after a successful transaction.
* **Notifications:** Push notifications for mobile (using Firebase) for "New Course Added" or "Quiz Due Soon."
* **Activity Logs:** A background "audit trail" that records every time a user logs in, starts a quiz, or finishes a module.

## 2. Technical Architecture Scope

To give your team a clear vision of how the data flows, here is a representation of the system architecture:

---

## 3. Feature Breakdown Table (The 3-Month Plan)

| Phase | Category | Feature | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Month 1** | **Foundation** | User Authentication (JWT), Profile CRUD, Role Setup. | High |
|  | **Core Data** | Course & Module CRUD (Instructor side), Category Search. | High |
| **Month 2** | **Learning Flow** | Video Player integration, Progress Tracking logic. | High |
|  | **Assessment** | Quiz Engine (Question/Answer/Scoring logic). | Medium |
| **Month 3** | **Operations** | Payment Gateway integration, Activity Logging. | Medium |
|  | **Polishing** | Push Notifications, API Documentation (Swagger), Final Deployment. | Low |

## 4. Database Schema Visualization

For your Database Analysis, here is how the primary tables will relate to each other. This is crucial for your MariaDB setup:

---

## 5. Implementation Strategy (The "Lead" Role)

As the Backend Lead, your scope includes:

1. **Environment Parity:** Ensuring your Docker container on the server matches your local development environment.
2. **API Performance:** Using **Indexing** in MariaDB for the `Course Catalog & Search` feature so search results are fast.
3. **Security:** * Validating that a student cannot access `Lesson B` if they haven't finished `Lesson A`.
* Ensuring only the "Instructor" who owns a course can edit it.


4. **Documentation:** Since your teammates are building the Android app, your Swagger/Postman documentation must be updated daily so they know which endpoints to call.

**Would you like me to generate a `docker-compose.yml` file specifically configured for your MariaDB and a Node/NestJS backend to get you started?**
